"""
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

"""
LeetCode: 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
